The solution involves carefully reviewing the project structure and ensuring that only one valid `google-services.json` file exists within the `android/app` directory.  Remove any extraneous `google-services.json` files located elsewhere in your project.  Ensure that the `google-services.json` file you are using is the correct file downloaded from the Firebase console for your project.

Here's a basic project structure showing the correct placement:

```
projectRoot/
├── android/
│   └── app/
│       └── google-services.json
└── ...
```

If you've copied the `google-services.json` file multiple times or placed it in an unexpected location, the build process will likely fail. This corrected structure ensures that the build process correctly identifies and utilizes the `google-services.json` file. After correcting the structure and cleaning your project, try running `expo build:android` again.
