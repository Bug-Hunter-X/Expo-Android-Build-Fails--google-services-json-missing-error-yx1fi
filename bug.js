This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The build process fails with the following error message:

`Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugGoogleServices`. > File google-services.json is missing. The Google Services Plugin requires a valid google-services.json file to exist in the project directory.  Make sure you have copied the correct file and that it is properly configured.

This error occurs even after properly configuring the `google-services.json` file in the `android/app` directory.  The project may have multiple `google-services.json` files at different levels which can create a conflict.
